OKAY SO HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS

We have an area. When someone enters the area, it throws up a description.
The var is 'narrate'.

/area/f13/tunnel/bighorn
	name = "\improper Bighorn Underground"
	narrate = "" < This is the important line.

/area/f13/building/hospital
	narrate = "The faint drone of medical equipment. The calming hum of medical machinery drones faintly onwards. Quiet pings and chimes echo."

/area/f13/wasteland/redwater
	narrate = "Bitter dust hangs in the air. The town in the distance looms. When the raiders on the wall see you, they laugh and point their guns at you- this area is dangerous. You feel like you shouldn't be here alone!!"
